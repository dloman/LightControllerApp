LightControllerApp
==================

This is an Android application to control the led strip controller server application

The application contains 2 modes. A color picker mode which uses the awesome color picker library https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker

and a sloshing mode which allows you to pick a direction and frequency for the lights to slosh from red to blue to green.
